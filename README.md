# Pig-Game

## GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

### Additional Rules (added throughout the coding):
1. There are two dices. The player looses his *current* score when one of them is a 1.
2. A player looses his **ENTIRE** score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. 
3. Players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100
